    <h2>Voice & Language</h2>
    
    <InstructionNote>
        Define the reading level and communication style of your brand. Create a "Do / Don't" list for plain language, and set structural rules for formatting social media.
        [Describe the target reading level and general tone of the brand. Provide guidelines on jargon, complex sentence structures, etc.]
    </InstructionNote>

    <h3>Plain Language Guidelines</h3>
    <p>CloakedCyber's outwards voice and tone should be set in a fantasy-inspired style around Locky protecting his tower,
        making clear the mtaphorical connection to making cybersecurity seamless and intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>CloakedCyber's programs and educational materials should be written at a 6th-8th grade reading level, using clear and concise language.
        Avoid technical jargon where possible, while still maintaining clarity and accuracy.
    </p>
